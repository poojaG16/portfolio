  <p class="text-lg max-w-3xl">
    Hi, I'm Pooja, a passionate Frontend Developer with expertise in Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG. I enjoy building interactive and visually appealing web applications. With a strong foundation in web development and a keen eye for design, I strive to deliver seamless user experiences.
    <br />
    <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket text-red-500"></i> I create fast, clean, and responsive UIs that users love and developers rely on. I migrated a sluggish PHP-based TDM tool to Angular using the PrimeNG library for faster development, cutting load times by 30% and boosting user satisfaction.
    <br />
    <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb text-yellow-500"></i> Separately, I led R&D on a real-time Workflow Builder using Angular 18, SVG, and state management libraries—accelerating workflow creation by 40% and transforming experimental UI concepts into scalable, real-world solutions.
    <br />
    <i class="fa-solid fa-code text-green-500"></i> My reusable components and sharp debugging skills consistently cut dev time in half—because I don’t just build interfaces, I build momentum.
  </p>
